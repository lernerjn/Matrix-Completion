# Image-Processing
For an example of smoothing using heat equation (and experimenting on my dog), 
run Heat_Equation_Smoothing_Example.m 

For examples of edge detection using geodesic active contours, run  

	[I] = EdgeDet( k , 0, ‘’, 0, 0) for k = 1 through 12

Background on both codes is provided in the Analysis folder
